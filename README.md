## Training Data Generation
Cartesian coordinates for multi-sphere clusters are generated with a cluster-cluster algorithm. 

Training data is generated by running the Fortran-90 implementation of the Multiple Sphere T-Matrix code (Mackowski and Mischenko, 2011). Example shell scripts for developing the training data code are found in the MSTMscripts folder.
