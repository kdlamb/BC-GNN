## Training Data Generation
Cartesian coordinates for multi-sphere clusters are generated with a cluster-cluster algorithm, which can be found at https://github.com/nmoteki/aggregate_generator 
(N. Moteki, “An efficient c++ code for generating fractal cluster of spheres (v1.1),” 2019).

Training data is generated by running the Fortran-90 implementation of the Multiple Sphere T-Matrix code (Mackowski and Mischenko, 2011). Example code for setting up batch scripts to run MSTM is given in run_mstm.py.

## Training the Model
The main training loop for the model is in the trainGCN.py script.
